\chapter {Future Experiments}

Towards the aim of generating parameterized summarization, the next step would be to manually generate summaries for a few articles that vary according to the parameters described in the text, and perform analyses on these generated summaries and see how similar/different they are to the original text.

It would also be interesting to first manually generate tweets from articles that vary in sentiment from a given subjective text, and see how this is achieved by picking out sentences with particular sentences from the article and using it to convey the sentiment given in the parameters. For example for a review of an object, picking out a sentence describing a negative feature for a negative sentiment in the parameter.
