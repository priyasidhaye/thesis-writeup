% \chapter*{Acknowledgements}
\begin{acknowledgements}

I would like to thank my supervisor, Jackie Cheung, who has been a teacher and advisor and helped me not just by guiding my thesis, but also by creating a fun research group that I am proud to be a part of.

I would like to thank Prof. Joelle Pineau for putting me in touch with Jackie for my thesis, Jad Kabbara for helping me translate my abstract to French, and everyone in the very large Reasoning and Learning lab family.

I would also like to thank my parents, my family and friends who have been a constant emotional support system, to be always relied upon.

I would like to thank Julian Brooke for providing the formality lexicon used in part of this study, and Prof. Derek Ruths for agreeing to be the external reviewer of the thesis.

Last but not the least, I thank the McGill University community for a wonderful experience and for teaching me a thing or two beyond the subjects I came here to study.
