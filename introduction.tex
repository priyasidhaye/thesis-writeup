Natural Language Generation is the process of generating human-readable texts. The generation system can take as an input another text itself, or some internal representation of data. Language generation has been used in systems for a long time in order to communicate information, ranging from a report generation to small text generation. One of the first successful generation systems used weather data to generate a report in the form of a daily weather update. 

Another type of generation systems take text as input, to produce a different kind of text. This kind of generation is called text-to-text generation. Summarization of text is an excellent example of text-to-text generation. The problem we look at during the course of this research is text-to-text generation between different genres of texts.
